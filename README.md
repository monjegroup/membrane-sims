lipid bilayers: a systematic study using molecular synamics simulations (submitted)

Description: This repository contains scripts used to analyze molecular dynamics simulation trajectories of lipid membranes. 
These were computed to examine the dependence of biophysical properties on membrane patch size in all atom simulations of 
complex lipid mixtures (6 species characteristic to eukaryotic cells). These files may be used as templates to compute lipid order 
deuterium parameters, lipid lateral density disrtibution heat maps, lipid aggregation events, lipid headgroup tilt angles, 
lipid tail splay angles, and lateral presure profiles. The scripts generate raw time series/matrices outputs that can be further 
processes for statistical analysis and visualization. These files are intended as templates, please read the comments carefuly and 
motify them as needed to suit your specific needs. 
Final coordinate and topology files of the twelve (12) systems examined for this study can be accessed at: 
[https://zenodo.org/records/15376633](https://zenodo.org/records/16040132). 
Trajectories are available upon request (jli436@buffalo.edu | vmonje@buffalo.edu)
