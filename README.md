Description: This repository contains files used to perform analysis of molecular dynamics simulation trajectories of lipid membranes. 
These were computed to examine the dependence of such properties on membrane patch size in all atom simulations of complex lipid mixtures
(6 species characteristic to eukaryotic cells). These files may be used as templates to compute lipid order deuterium parameters, 
lipid lateral density disrtibution heat maps, lipid aggregation events, lipid headgroup tilt angles, lipid tail splay angles, and lateral
presure profiles. Please read the comments carefuly and edit according to your system(s) needs. 
Final coordinate and topology files of the twelve (12) systems examined for this study can be accessed at: 
[https://zenodo.org/records/15376633](https://zenodo.org/records/16040132). 
Trajectories are available upon request (jli436@buffalo.edu | vmonje@buffalo.edu)
